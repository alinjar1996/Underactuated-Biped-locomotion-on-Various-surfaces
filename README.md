# Underactuated-Biped-locomotion-on-Various-surfaces
This repository contains MATLAB codes of stable locomotion in underactuated biped on various surfaces. The surfaces are flat, with a 2-degree incline, a 4-degree incline, and circular, circular, and 4-degree incline.

The kinematic architecture of the biped and the necessary controller gains and initial hip joint velocity to generate stable locomotion can be seen here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1avJoYTizMqy7LkSyH8jVPKUDYw3WpKFH?usp=sharing.

To run the simulation and animation, please run the following codes:

1. Level ground locomotion: self_excited_main_flat.m
   
2. 2 Degree inclined ground locomotion: selfexcited_main_2degincline
   
3. 4 Degree inclined ground locomotion: selfexcited_main_4degincline
 
4. Circular ground locomotion: selfexcited_main_circleroc8

5. Circular ground followed by 4 Degree incline locomotion: selfexcited_main_circle_incline.m

To generate various locomotion characteristics of locomotion run the following codes:

1. Level ground locomotion: Differentresults_flatsurface.m
   
2. 2 Degree inclined ground locomotion: Differentresults_2degincline.m
   
3. 4 Degree inclined ground locomotion: Differentresults_4degincline.m
   
4. Circular ground locomotion: Differentresults_circular.m

5. Circular ground followed by 4 Degree incline locomotion: Differentresults_circular_inc.m
